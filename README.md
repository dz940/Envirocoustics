An Interactive Auditory and Visual DSP-Based tool for Simulating Environmental Effects on Sound Propagation using C++ and JUCE.

Sound travels through air as pressure waves, and its behaviour is influenced by the physical characteristics of the surrounding environment. 
Understanding how atmospheric and meteorological factors affect sound is essential in education, where interactive explanations can enhance 
learning in acoustics and physics. Environmental conditions such as temperature, humidity, and wind influence key aspects of sound propagation, 
including speed, attenuation, and frequency response. These effects are governed by well-established physical principles but are often difficult 
to visualise in a classroom setting. Existing simulation tools typically focus on analytical modelling or offline processing, offering limited 
interactivity. There is currently a lack of accessible, real-time educational tools that allow learners to interactively explore how environmental 
factors influence sound propagation. Here we present an interactive, real-time tool that enables users to both hear and visualise the effects of 
temperature, humidity, pressure and wind on sound propagation. Unlike traditional models, this tool provides immediate auditory and visual feedback, 
making complex acoustic phenomena more intuitive. By integrating realtime digital signal processing with interactive controls, it bridges the gap 
between theoretical understanding and experiential learning in environmental acoustics. Such tools can enhance science and engineering education 
by making abstract principles more engaging. More broadly, interactive simulations support deeper learning and can be applied to other domains where
environmental conditions affect physical systems. This approach provides a more engaging way to explore fundamental principles of acoustics, relevant 
across disciplines.
